# LandingPage for a website
In my internship, I got a task to create a landing page for a website that is offered by Prodigy Info Tech.




## Demo

## Features

1. Navigation Bar
 - Fixed Position: The navbar stays at the top of the page, ensuring that navigation options are always accessible as the user scrolls.
 - Logo Section (Left): Displays the website's name or logo for branding.
 - Menu Section (Center): Contains links (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact) that help navigate to different sections of the page.
 - Login Button (Right): A prominent button designed to draw attention for users to log in, with hover effects for better interactivity.
 - Responsive Design: The navbar adjusts its layout for smaller screens using a media query, ensuring a good experience on all devices.
 - Scroll Effect: The navbar changes its background color and adds a shadow when the user scrolls down the page for a polished and dynamic feel.
2. Hero Section
 - Full-Page Height: Covers the entire viewport height to make a strong first impression.
 - Text Content: Includes a welcome message (Welcome to Our Professional Website) and a brief description of the website's purpose.
 - Call-to-Action Button: A prominent "Get Started" button encourages users to take action.
3. Animations:
 - Fade-In Animation: The section smoothly appears as the page loads.
 - Slide-Down/Slide-Up Animations: The heading and paragraph have smooth entrance effects for better visual appeal.
4. Page Sections
 - About Section: Provides information about the organization or individual.
 - Services Section: Highlights the services offered.

5. Each section is styled with:

 - Even/Odd Backgrounds: Alternating background colors improve readability and visual separation.
 - Consistent Typography: All sections use clean fonts and hierarchy for headings and paragraphs.
6. Smooth Transitions
 - Hover Effects: Buttons and menu items change color, background, and slightly scale up for an engaging user experience.
 - Navbar Hover States: Menu items subtly transform to provide feedback during interaction.
7. Responsive Design
 - Adaptability: The layout is adjusted for mobile devices: 
 - Menu items stack vertically for better usability.
 - The login button aligns appropriately in smaller viewports.
8. Animations
 - Keyframe Animations: Added to enhance the visual experience:
 - FadeIn: Elements smoothly appear as the page loads.
 - SlideUp and SlideDown: Create subtle movement for text elements in the hero section.
9. Accessibility and Usability
